Come join us for an hour-long resume-crafting and \texttt{github.io} boot camp. A few (really rad) upperclassmen will lead a hands-on tutorial on showcasing your talents in a resume and making yourself a \texttt{github.io} page to display it on. We'll walk you through step-by-step and help you make your professional web presence your own. Plus, we'll have snacks! Whether you are totally new to programming or have been around the block a few times, we want to see you there! We are looking forward to building social connections between new members of the CS department and older students.
